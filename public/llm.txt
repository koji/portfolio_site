Project: Personal Portfolio Website

Core Purpose:
This project is a personal portfolio website for Koji, a developer and creator. It showcases professional work experience, personal projects, an "About Me" section, and contact information. The website aims to present Koji's skills, experience, and personality in a visually appealing and interactive manner.

Key Features:
- Single Page Application (SPA) with smooth scrolling navigation.
- Sections:
    - Home (Hero): Introduction with a call to action.
    - About: Information about Koji's developer journey, philosophy, and tech stack.
    - Work Projects: Displays professional projects with descriptions, technologies, highlights, and links.
    - Personal Projects: Showcases personal experiments and open-source contributions with descriptions, technologies, status, category, and links (GitHub, Live Demo).
    - Contact: Provides ways to get in touch, including an email address and links to a blog and direct email.
- Responsive Design: Adapts to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Theme Toggling: Supports light, dark, and system preference themes.
- Interactive UI: Utilizes buttons, cards, badges, and dropdown menus for a dynamic user experience.
- Animations: Subtle animations for section loading, hover effects, and background elements.
- Custom Shader Background: A Three.js powered animated bonsai-themed background (`BonsaiShaderBackground.tsx`) for visual interest.
- Multilingual Elements: Incorporates Japanese text for stylistic and personal branding purposes.

Main Technologies Used:
- Frontend Framework: Next.js (React)
- Language: TypeScript
- UI Components: Shadcn/UI (customizable components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS)
    - Specific components used: Card, Button, Badge, DropdownMenu, Dialog (implied by shadcn/ui usage, though not explicitly in provided files).
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- 3D Graphics/Animation: Three.js (for the `BonsaiShaderBackground`)
- Icons: Lucide React
- State Management: React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Navigation: Client-side smooth scrolling to sections.

Directory Structure & Key Components (src/components):
- `Hero.tsx`: The landing section of the website.
- `About.tsx`: Section describing Koji, his philosophy, and tech stack.
- `WorkProjects.tsx`: Component to display professional projects.
- `PersonalProjects.tsx`: Component to display personal projects.
- `Contact.tsx`: Contact information and form/links.
- `Navigation.tsx`: Handles site navigation (desktop and mobile), including a dropdown for projects and theme toggle integration.
- `ThemeToggle.tsx`: Component for switching between light, dark, and system themes.
- `BonsaiShaderBackground.tsx`: A custom Three.js shader for an animated background.
- `ProjectLink.tsx`: A reusable component for "View Project" buttons.
- `ui/`: Contains components from Shadcn/UI (e.g., `button.tsx`, `card.tsx`, `badge.tsx`).
- `data/`: Likely contains data for projects (e.g., `workPrjData.ts`, `personalPrjData.ts`).

Overall Architecture:
The application is structured as a single-page website built with Next.js and React. Components are well-defined and modular, promoting reusability and maintainability. Styling is primarily handled by Tailwind CSS, with custom UI components from Shadcn/UI. State management is local to components using React Hooks. The `BonsaiShaderBackground` adds a unique visual element using Three.js.
